# hello-world
Tutorial from Github.com
I'm a student of LaunchCode in St Louis, MO.  A wonderful organization that is available to learn how to code.  It's very professional and friendly plus absolutely free. You do have to take an aptitude exam to be accepted.  The exam is not difficult.  They look for qualities in you that are essential in coding i.e. logic thinking, basic math.

My journey has been challenging.  It's fast paced and sometimes you do feel discouraged and may think "Am I dense? why is this concept so difficult to understand?".  But don't dispair and stay on course.  Coding is similar to learning a brand new language.  In this case, it's learning how to communicate with the digital machine/cloud world.

"There's a method to the madness":  Be patient and stay at it. Persevere and you will conquer. If you find a concept difficult to grasp, ask questions, read and review the chapters, do your exercises and Studios.

"You need to know the fundamentals to make it fun": The key to making progress is to understand the fundamentals i.e. what is a primitive value, what are the types of primitive values, what makes a function, what is an object, etc.  Pretty soon the coding language will start to make sense; your perception will change, you will be encouraged to learn new things and advance in your knowledge.  It will be the fun of fundametals :)

"Team work makes the dream work":  You can't do this alone.  You will need to seek help and not be shy, or embarrased about it.  Reach out to the TAs, fellow team mates, people you may know in the community.  And then pay it back and help others as you gain or while you are gaining knowledge yourself.  If someone's attitude, at one point or another, is terse, cold, impatient, etc. do not take it personally.  Their attitude is not a reflection of who you are and what you can accomplish. Only you can allow them to affect you.  Besides, you don't know what it's going on in their mind at that moment and you might misinterpret their response.  Check yourself too :)
