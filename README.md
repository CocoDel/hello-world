As a student of the September 2020 LaunchCode-101 in St Louis, Missouri I would like to give you a brief view of my journey in this course.  LauchCode is a wonderful organization that teaches how to code.  Currently we are learning JavaScript and Java.  The organization, is professional and friendly and the best part is that it is absolutely free. You do have to take an aptitude exam to be accepted.  But the exam is not difficult.  They look for qualities in you that are essential to coding i.e. logic thinking, basic math.

My journey has been challenging.  If you have zero knowledge or experience in coding, the course is fast paced.  Sometimes you do feel discouraged and may think "Am I dense? why is this concept so difficult to understand?".  But don't dispair and stay on course.  Coding is similar to learning a brand new language.  In this case, it's learning how to communicate with the digital machine/cloud world.  My recommendation is that if you have had zero experience or knowledge in coding you allow yourself 20 to 30 hours to code.  A part time job is best if you need to have some income.  

"There's a method to the madness":  Be patient and stay at it. Persevere and you will conquer. If you find a concept difficult to grasp, ask questions, read and review the chapters, do your exercises and Studios.

"You need to know the fundamentals to make it fun": The key to making progress is to understand the fundamentals i.e. what is a primitive value, what are the types of primitive values, what makes a function, what is an object, etc.  Pretty soon the coding language will start to make sense; your perception will change, you will be encouraged to learn new things and advance in your knowledge.  It will be the fun of fundametals :)

"Team work makes the dream work":  You can't do this alone.  You will need to seek help and not be shy, or embarrased about it.  Reach out to the TAs, fellow team mates, people you may know in the community.  And then pay it back and help others as you gain or while you are gaining knowledge yourself.  If someone's attitude, at one point or another, is terse, cold, impatient, etc. do not take it personally.  Their attitude is not a reflection of who you are and what you can accomplish. Only you can allow them to affect you.  Besides, you don't know what it's going on in their mind at that moment and you might misinterpret their response.  Check yourself too :)
